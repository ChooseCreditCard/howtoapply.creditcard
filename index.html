    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>Purpose of a Credit Card Application Form</h2>
      <p>
        A credit card application form is the issuer’s way of collecting the data they need to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>verify your identity and meet regulatory requirements,</li>
        <li>assess affordability and risk,</li>
        <li>understand how the card may be used,</li>
        <li>decide whether to approve, decline or request more information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The exact questions differ by country and bank, but the structure is usually similar. This page is not
        a recommendation to apply – it is an explanation of what these forms are doing in the background.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Form fields -->
    <section id="form" class="section">
      <h2>Common Sections on Application Forms</h2>
      <p>
        While layouts differ, you will often see sections like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal details:</strong> name, date of birth, address history, contact details. Used to
          identify you and match your credit file, where applicable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Employment and income:</strong> job type, employer, length of employment, salary,
          additional income. Used to estimate ability to repay.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Existing debts and commitments:</strong> other cards, loans, mortgages, or regular
          payments that affect affordability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage expectations:</strong> sometimes issuers ask about intended use, such as travel,
          day-to-day spending or balance transfers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal consents:</strong> permissions to run credit checks, share data with bureaus, or send
          you documents electronically.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is important to answer truthfully and carefully. Incorrect information can lead to wrong decisions
        and, in some regions, legal consequences.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Checks & review -->
    <section id="checks" class="section">
      <h2>What Happens After You Submit</h2>
      <p>
        Once you click “submit”, the issuer typically runs a series of automated and sometimes manual checks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Identity checks</strong> against official records or databases.</li>
        <li><strong>Credit bureau checks</strong> (often a “hard” inquiry) to see past repayment behaviour.</li>
        <li><strong>Affordability calculations</strong> based on income, debts and limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk scoring</strong> using internal models that combine different factors.</li>
        <li><strong>Additional documentation requests</strong> if something is unclear or needs proof.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        Even if you fill in the form perfectly, approval is not guaranteed. Issuers have their own policies,
        risk appetite and regulatory obligations that you cannot see from the outside.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Using applications wisely -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Applying in a Thoughtful Way</h2>
      <p>
        Because applications can affect your credit file in some countries, it can be helpful to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>understand the basic terminology (APR, credit limit, minimum payment) before you apply,</li>
        <li>avoid submitting many applications in a short time if your market uses “hard” checks,</li>
        <li>keep records of what you agreed to and what documents you received from the issuer,</li>
        <li>review the issuer’s official terms and fee tables before accepting an offer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        None of this is advice for your specific situation – it is general, educational context about how the process often works.
